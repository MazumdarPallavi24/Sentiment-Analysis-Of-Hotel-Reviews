Hotel Industry is a burgeoning field. Our team helped Hotel owners improve the service they provide to the customers and customers to get the desired services they pay for.
We performed Sentiment Analysis of customer reviews from TripAdvisor Website by scrapping the reviews.We built a Topic Model using Bert to classify reviews as positive or negetive. To understand which areas needs improvement on the part of the hotel services offered we divided the Service Parameters into 6 categories.
