# Sentiment-Analysis-Of-Hotel-Reviews
Hotel Industry is a burgeoning industry. Our team helped Hotel owners improve the service they provide to the customers and customers to get the desired services they pay for.
We tried to perform Sentiment Analysis of customer reviews from TripAdvisor Website by scrapping the reviews.We built a Topic Model using Bert Model to classify reviews as positive or negetive. To understand which areas needs improvement on the part of the hotel services offered we divided the Service Parameters into 6 categories.
